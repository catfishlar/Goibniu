manage data on a database for anonymization analysis and qa testing.

I started playing with this idea in 2012.  Sat dormant for a while. 

Started as an idea for playing with Scala Play.  Eventually I came back 
to this for a anonymization project and did it in rails.   My first Rails app.
Its pretty ugly but it helped me with my task. 

Putting this in public to see if my pride will make me clean it up. 

There are some other projects that I want to add to that I need to clean up a bit.
